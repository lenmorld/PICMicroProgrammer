The PC-Based Microcontroller Programmer and Training Kit is a device that utilizes the PIC Microcontrollers to guide students and hobbyists on interfacing with microcontrollers. The software and hardware package can also be used in developing applications for the PIC MCU and the training kit modules included.

## General Objective
This project aims to develop a PC - Based Microcontroller Programmer
and Training Kit.  

#### Specific Objectives 
Specifically, this study aims to:

1. Develop a microcontroller programmer for a variety of PIC Microcontrollers

    * The developers used a 40-pin ZIF (Zero Insertion Force) socket
    that can accommodate 8/14/18/28/40 â€“ pin PIC Microcontrollers. The ZIF     socket allows easy removal of the MCU chips through a lever on its side that can be moved easily to lock or unlock the inserted chip. It
reduces strain to the IC pins compared to traditional sockets where the chip is placed by pushing and removed by pulling.

2. Develop an MCU training kit with a variety of electronic devices The training kit included separate modules containing LEDs, 7-
segment Display, pushbuttons, LCD, Dot Matrix display, motor, and a sensor. 

    * These devices are commonly used in electronic projects. 
    * The LEDs represent the logic of the MCU pins clearly and are suitable for beginners for they are easy to interface. 
    * The 7-segment displays are good numerical indicators, while the LCD is suitable for displaying messages. Pushbuttons are essential in studying MCU input and can be used for event-triggered applications. 
    * The LED Matrix display can be used to show text in an attractive manner. The motor used is a stepper motor which can be controlled to rotate with accuracy. 
    * Stepper motors can be found in devices and mechanisms that require precise movement and positioning. The sensor used is a temperature sensor that can accurately read ambient temperature.
This provides a good start in learning analog input and Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC).

3. Develop a beginner- oriented software with Virtual Emulator The developers designed a GUI application that provides experiments that can be customized by the user. Included in the software is a Virtual Emulator that will display the experiments graphically through a simple animation. The developers used Visual Basic to develop this software.

4. Develop an efficient communication link between the host PC and the device.
The developers implemented USB communication between the host PC and the device. A USB cable is also provided to the user.
